# Statistics-Project
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mick Kohler
**I am a programming starter and student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.**
This little program is a project aimed at delivering software, with which one can calculate statistical values and explore statistical concepts.
The program can execute and calculate the following:
- mean
- harmonic mean
- weighted mean
- arithmetic mean

**To be continued for...**
- range
- mean absolute deviation
- mean quadratic deviation
- variance
- standard deviation
- coefficient of variation (+ normed version)
- quartile dispersion coefficient
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
- Gini coefficient
  
Caution: At the moment, handling is only provided with unclassified data.
