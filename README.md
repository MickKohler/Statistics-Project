### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mick Kohler
**I am a programming starter and student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.**

The program can execute and calculate the following:
- mean
- arithmetic mean
- mean square deviation
- Pearson correlation coefficient
  and many more...
Caution: At the moment, handling is only provided with unclassified data.
